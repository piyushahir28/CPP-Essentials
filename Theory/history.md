# C++ Programming Language

C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. This language allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers.

## C++ is:

- **Compiled:** It needs a compiler to convert code into machine language.

- **Statically typed:** Data types must be defined before compilation.

- **Multi-paradigm:** Supports multiple programming styles, including:

  - Procedural programming (like C)
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): using classes, inheritance, - polymorphism, etc.
  - Generic programming: using templates

- **Fast and Efficient:** Used where performance and memory control are critical.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout<<"Welcome to CPP Essentials."

  return 0;
}
```

- The `#include` is a preprocessor directive tells the compiler to include the content of a file in the source code. For example, `#include<iostream>` tells the compiler to include the input-output library which contains all C++â€™s input/output library functions.
- This `using namespace std` is used to import the entity of the stdnamespace into the current namespace of the program. It is basically the space where all the inbuilt features of C++ are declared. For example, `std::cout`.

- **Keywords:** Keywords are predefined word that gets reserved for working program that have special meaning and cannot get used anywhere else.
- **Identifiers:** Identifiers are the values used to define different programming items such as variables, integers, structures, unions and others and mostly have an alphabetic character.
- **Literals:** Literals are fundamental elements used to represent fixed values. These values can include numbers, characters, strings, and more. They are generally present as the right operand in the assignment operation.
