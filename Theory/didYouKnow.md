- **Is C++ Machine Independent?**
  A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however, they are machine-independent. Let us understand this feature of C++ with the help of an example. Suppose you have written a piece of code that can run on Linux/Windows/Mac OSx which makes the C++ Machine Independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot run on different operating systems. So in general we can say it is Machine independent.
